# My Favorite Things

Inspired by a [post from Aaroh Mankad](https://aarohmankad.notion.site/Things-I-Love-36569f3b641f44139baa63288fea7c21), I thought it would be cute to list a bunch of things I enjoy using/owning.

These won't necessarily be surprising to you, but they're items that have both meaningfully changed some part of my life and excite me. So I thought it would be a nice thing to share.

## Tech

This is just an astro project. I'm trying to use as little JS as possible, although some might not be avoidable.

A lot of the styling was stolen from the default template. This is not "show off my design" project.
