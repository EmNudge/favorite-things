Don't get me wrong. I love a good [metal water bottle (with straw)](/water_bottle_(with_straw)) as much as the next guy, but when traveling, you gotta travel light.

A collapsible water bottle is the lightest way to stay hydrated in foreign lands. When empty, it takes up virtually no space in your bag. But when you need to hydrate, it expands to a normal-sized bottle.

It's even more compact than a regular plastic water bottle and significantly cheaper in the long term. Don't want it taking up room in your bag directly? Clip it to the side with the attached carabiner!
