It's the perfect compromise between a lined notebook and graph paper. A lined notebook prevents you from sketching vertically through the lines and graph paper is often too noisy for regular writing. A dotted notebook lets you follow the loose guides for writing, but also allows larger sketches that are optionally aligned on a grid.

I prefer a much lighter dotted notebook if possible, which is something difficult to tell in person. It should be light enough to not be visible from afar. You don't want the dots distracting from the actual writing.
