Hotel TVs suck. For real. They're there as a distraction, but not something you'd willingly use if given the choice. Missing netflix? Annoyed that your only option is an 8-inch screen held 4 inches from your face? Turn your hotel TV into a media center!

Watch movies! Play spotify! Browse YouTube! Ask google assistant dumb questions.

It's $30, so Google is definitely losing money on this. But they also **really** want you to buy one so... be cautious?
