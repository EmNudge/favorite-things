I love offering these to guests. Is this socially acceptable? Probably not, but it's a lot of fun. These are incredibly minty and completely throw people off when they're expecting a light mint taste.

It's also a good way to avoid habitual snacking. When your hands want to wander to some chips, pull out a toothpick instead. You also look super cool.
