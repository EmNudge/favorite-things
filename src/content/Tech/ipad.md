Look, I don't know what Apple is doing, but Apple clearly knows what Apple is doing because they pop out banger products.

Pricey? Maybe. But also genre-defining. The ipad is the best tablet hands-down. The competition has been running into brick walls and restarting under new names for a decade.

I use mine to read articles a lot. It's also great for watching movies in the kitchen. Or you can draw on it. Or take notes. 

There's also this amazing app called [Nomad Sculpt](https://nomadsculpt.com/) which lets you do 3D sculpting on the tablet. It's incredibly relaxing. Also here's a [secret web demo](https://nomadsculpt.com/demo) of their app.
