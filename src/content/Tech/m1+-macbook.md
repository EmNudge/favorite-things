If you're getting a MacBook, it's gotta be something *M1* or later.

If you're not getting a MacBook, you should probably get a MacBook. They last forever (compared to competitors), they're fast, they're power efficient, they're light, and they're stylish. 
* If you're a programmer - they're unix based.
* If you're a designer - they've got nice screens.
* If you're a productivity freak - they've got a great trackpad and shortcuts system. 

If you're still not getting a laptop, you probably have a very specialized use case or you are "big dumb" (as the kids say).
