description: A wireless headset that isn't horrible

The best wireless headphones. Really. 

The bluetooth standard has been a serious obstacle in hardware audio improvements. It hard-limits the audio quality by choosing a small bandwidth and bad codec.

These don't use bluetooth! It provides a wireless access point via USB which does its own thing!
