Before I start, yes, it's expensive. It's really expensive. But it's also somewhat of an art piece. It's compact and it does it all. It's restrictive in certain aspects, but that restriction breeds creativity.

Teenage Engineering knows what they're doing. Everything they produce is a piece of art, but also almost prohibitively expensive. Save money by buying it used. The original OP-1 is still incredible after all this time and many are letting theirs go in near perfect condition.
