description: A mobile recorder AND interface. Be with the pros!

If you're in the audio industry, you probably know this one. It lets you record audio on the go, but using professional mics! It has 2 inputs for 2 separately controlled channels. 

It's also not a bad interface by itself. Let it replace your Scarlet 2i2! It's also got a great on-board mic. Let it replace your entire mic setup! Although it's a bit sensitive to plosives, so get [a deadcat](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KW865KE/) if you're using the on-board mic.
