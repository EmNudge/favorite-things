It's widely available (probably some manufacturer in china pumping them out), but wildly comfortable and not an eye sore! It's good for reading books, watching movies, playing games, or meditating like a nerd.

It's multi-functional! Hell, I'd probably get this first before I get a couch if I ever move again. Couch shopping is considerably more difficult and it's nice to have a temporary relaxation pod.
