Only plausible option for shaping your eyebrows. Those dollar store plastic shapers are only good for 1 or 2 times.

I kind of wanted something that used regular blades so that I could share blades with the [Leaf Razor](/leaf-razor). You do have to be very careful with how you angle it, but you can't use a regular razor to get at your eyebrows since you end up covering your eyes.
