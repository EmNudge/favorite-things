description: Use razor blades and also don't kill yourself

Cleanest shave I've ever gotten. By far.

Uses real razor blades, so replacing the head is super cheap (even though the handle itself is crazy expensive). It bends to the shape of the surface, so it's almost always at the right angle.

Less worrying about cutting yourself, more worrying about getting that beard-shape just right.
