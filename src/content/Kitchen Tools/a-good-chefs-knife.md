What do you cook with?! A plastic butter knife?! For what reason? To spite me? To specifically hurt me? Because I'm not good enough?! Huh?! Well?!

Get a nice chef's knife. It makes cooking way more enjoyable. If you want to cook more, enhancing your cooking experience is a great way to do it!

Also you can brag about having a cool-ass knife to your friends. I hear [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001TPFPVE) is quite good too.
