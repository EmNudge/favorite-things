What's your alternative? A knife?! Heresy! Heresy, I say!

You can use a chef's knife and mince your garlic real smooth (ish) and get a bunch of tiny clumps. Better yet, you can use a grater for a phenomenal result and almost grind your finger down!

OR! OR! OR you can use a garlic press and get the best of both worlds! A nice paste and all your fingers intact.
