I think this was originally meant for people with arthritis, but don't let that scare you (they scare me too)!

It sounds like it's only for the lazy, but it's also for those who are scared. I am scared. Of being cut with the lid of the can. And also other things...

This electric automatic can opener cuts perfectly each time! You get a result with no sharp edges! And It doesn't break down on every 5th can you try opening.

...It also emits an **annoyingly loud** sound.
