Hey, it's the language of the web. Why not *love it*?

It's got doses of functional and imperative. It's got all these great APIs. It's got eldritch devil-loving horrors beyond your comprehension and also prototypical inheritance.  

It's also a great beginner language for a variety of reasons that I won't be typing here.
