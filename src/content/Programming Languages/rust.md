On top of being a language with "memory safety" or whatever that means, it's also a modern language built on top of all the learnings of the previous ones. Its design just makes sense in so many areas.

[Algebraic types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type), [HOF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) chaining, expression flow control, immutability by default!

So many things I wished for in a language exist in rust.
